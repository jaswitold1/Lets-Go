<h1>Overview</h1>
App designed to share Your favourite places with other people. First, let it locate You, then sign in and add Your own places, delete them, enjoy what others have shared. All data stored in Firebase Storage and Firebase Real-time database. Map implemented with Leaflet. Routing based on React Router. For managing state and for asynchronous API calls I have used Redux with Thunk. 

Site was created with Responsive Design in mind.
